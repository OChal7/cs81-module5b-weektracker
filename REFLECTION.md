Reflection on activityTracker.js

1. Were your predictions accurate?
Highest enjoyment: I predicted “dinner with friends,” and indeed that activity tied for the top enjoyment score of 8
Popular category: I guessed “health” would dominate, and it did—with 4 out of 7 days
Pattern: I thought evenings would be most enjoyable, but the average evening enjoyment (6.5) was same as afternoon average (6.5)

2. What surprised you about your week?
I wasnt too surprised with any of the reuslts other than noticing that average enjoyment at eveneing was same as afternoon.  I would predict that if I populated the data with more examples it would favor eveninng enjoyment.  

3. Which higher-order function was most useful and why?
I found reduce the most helpful. It lets me loop through my list once and combine totaling hours or finding the highest rating—in quickly.
